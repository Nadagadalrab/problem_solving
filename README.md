some python problems
Tasks :
 Problem 1 : "Daily Steps Tracker"
 Description:
 You have a list of the number of steps taken each day in a month. Your task is to write a
 program that performs the following:
 1. Accepts the number of steps taken each day in the month as numbers separated by
 spaces.
 2. Calculates the highest and lowest step counts.
 3. Calculates the average daily step count.
 4. Sorts the step counts in descending order.
 Problem 2: "Library Book Borrowing Analysis"
 Description:
 You have a record of books borrowed from a library for a month. Each record includes the book
 title and the number of days it was borrowed. Your task is to write a program that performs the
 following:
 1. Accepts a list of borrowed books with the format: "Book Title- Days Borrowed".
 2. Calculates the most and least borrowed book based on the number of days.
 3. Calculates the average number of days books were borrowed.
 4. Finds the unique titles of all borrowed books.
 5. Sorts the books by the number of days borrowed in descending order.
 Requirements:
 ● Useadictionary to store book titles as keys and their total borrowed days as values.
 (search)
 ● Useasettofind unique titles of books borrowed. (search)
 ● Calculate the most and least borrowed book, the average borrowing time, and sort books
 by borrowing duration.
Problem 3 : "Word Scramble Game"
 Description:
 Create a word scramble game where the program randomly scrambles a word and gives the
 player a set number of attempts to guess the original word.
 Requirements:
 1. The program should start by selecting a random word from a predefined list of words.
 2. The selected word should be scrambled (characters shuffled in a random order).
 3. Display the scrambled word to the player and ask them to guess the original word.
 4. The player should have 5 attempts to guess the word correctly.
 5. For each incorrect guess, the player should be informed how many attempts they have
 left.
 6. If the player guesses correctly within the attempts, display a congratulatory message.
 7. If the player runs out of attempts, reveal the original word.
 8. Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., empty input).
 Example Interaction:
 Example Word:
 Suppose the chosen word is "apple", which the program scrambles to "pleap".
 GameFlow:
 Welcome to the Word Scramble Game!
 Try to guess the original word from the scrambled word: pleap
 You have 5 attempts.
 Enter your guess: leap
 Incorrect! Try again. You have 4 attempts left.
 Enter your guess: apple
 Congratulations! You guessed the correct word!
You’re out of attempts! The correct word was: apple
 Note : You must initialize a list of words and select a random word
 from it.
